World Render Library allows modders to easily render parts of the world and use it in their projects.

Library changes portals from Portal Gun to render terrarin on the other side of the portal.
Library adds gif recording capabilities to Capture Mode.

All code for using renderer can be found on mod's homepage (https://github.com/Ved-s/WorldRenderLib)
