World Render Library allows modders to easily render parts of the world and use it in their projects.

As an example of doing that, library changes portals from Portal Gun to render terrarin on the other side of the portal.
All code for doing that can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/Ved-s/WorldRenderLib/blob/master/PortalGateHooks2.cs
